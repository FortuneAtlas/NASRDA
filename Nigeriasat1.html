            <h4 class="card-title font-weight-bold text-left">NigeriaSat-1</h4>
            <h5 class="card-text text-left">On 26 September 2003 Nigeria launched its $13 million national satellite NigeriaSat-1
              in Plesetsk, Russia under a seven-nation constellation being handled by a Russian firm, Cosmos. Nigeriasat-1 is a
              low earth orbit micro satellite for disaster monitoring looking spacecraft, 5-year target design life-span orbit
              700km. The launching of the National Satellite, which started development in November 2001, had been postponed
              from July 2003 because the Russian Space Agency had to launch a military satellite during that period. NigeriaSat-1
               is one of five satellites which will make up a network called the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The other
               partners in the international consortium are UK, China, Algeria, Turkey, Thailand and Vietnam. Each satellite
               belongs to one country, but they will share information with each other when disaster monitoring is needed.
               The Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellites, which cost less than $10 million each, are built by a
               British-based company, Surrey Satellite Technology, which has also trained technicians from Nigeria and some
               of the other countries involved. The processed images from the DMC will be distributed to relief teams by the
               Reuters AlterNet Foundation. The Reuters Foundation launched AlertNet in 1997 to help the work of relief
                professionals around the world.</h5>

            <img src="images/NigeriaSat1image.png" width="280" class="mx-auto d-flex">
          <br><h5 class="text-left">NigeriaSat-1 has 3 spectral bands namely; Green: 0.52-0.62µm, Red: 0.63-0.69 µm and NIR:
            0.76-0.9 µm. It is one of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellites and has a swath width of 600km
            and revisit cycle of 3-5 days. It has spectral resolution comparable to SPOT XS and spatial resolution comparable
            to Landsat TM. The camera is operated in two banks and used to produce images with approximately 32 m ground
            sampling distance (spatial resolution), across a swath width of approximately 600 x 600 km.<br><br>
            The Institute comprises of the Department of Space Science and Department of Aerospace Engineering Systems,
            with programmes drawn from the specialized studies in Space Sciences, Engineering, Mathematics, Computerization,
             and Technology Innovations leading to the award of Master of Science (MSc.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree.</h5>
             <h5 class="text-left">The combination of these characteristics implies that NigeriaSat-1 has great potentials for
               forestry monitoring. With this satellite in space, the problem of data access for forest monitoring is no longer
               there and the time is now ripe for utilization of space acquired information in natural resources management.
               However, there is an urgent need for capacity building in space science technology applications, which is
               currently below the critical mass, if the country is to derive maximum benefit from NigeriaSat-1.<br>
               The epoch making event drew ovation as well as bewilderment from many people. To the skeptics, it was seen as one
               of those foolhardy events resulting from misplaced priorities and one that was going to be the first and the last
                of its type. After three years of near-flawless operation in orbit, and delivery of over 3000 images that have
                 been utilized locally and internationally, our highly elated President has not only commended the National
                 Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) for the monumental success of NigeriaSat-1 but has also directed
                  the manufacture of two other satellites, a communications satellite - NigComSat-1 and a second earth observation
                  satellite - NigeriaSat-2; the latter is expected to replace NigeriaSat-1.<br>
                The programmes provide students with training and skills in analysis, designs and monitoring of space systems.
                Human centred design and development studies are incorporated into every facet of learning at the Institute to
                emphasize the role of space science and technology in achieving the sustainable development goals in Africa.</h5>

            <h5 class="text-left headlinebody">Nigeriasat-1 data continue to enhance sustainable development and support disaster management
              in the country and other parts of the world. The data is currently being used to address key socio-economic
              problems in the country, for example revision of the Land Use/Land Cover, which was last revised in 1995 using
              SPOT imageries; Satellite-based Environmental Change Research in the Niger-Delta area; Development of
              Predictive Models for Desertification Early Warning; Mapping and Monitoring of the Impact of Gully Erosion
              in South-Eastern part of Nigeria; Settlements and Major Roads Mapping Project; Flood Mapping in the Kainji
               Lake Area; Deforestation in the South-Western part of Nigeria etc.
              <br> As part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), Nigeriasat-1 images have been used in various part
              of the world for disaster management e.g. Asian Tsunami disaster (20 of 300 X 150 Km supplied); Huricanne Katrina
              etc. In 2007, Nigeriasat-1 data through International Charter has been used to respond to floods in
              Argentina/Parguay, Uruguay,North Korea, Pakistan, China, Vietnam, North Korea, New York, West Africa;
              volcanic eruption in Nevado, Columbia, Yemen; oil spill in Lyme-Bay, UK; fires in California; locust threat
              in Algeria, Syria etc. These images along with other DMC images are made available free of charge for disaster
              management. In conjunction with other DMC satellites, Nigeriasat-1 has also been used for various mapping campaign
              e.g. the Amazon, Vietnam coastal areas, European Union States.</h5>
